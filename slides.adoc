== Introduction
    * Social media is a great tool for engaging with social/political movements.
        ** link:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2017.1334931['The social media response to Black Lives Matter: how Twitter users interact with Black Lives Matter through hashtag use' by Ince et al.] 
            ... to demonstrate solidarity
            ... to help organize small grievances into a larger mass movement
            ... to actively engage in the counter-movement

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== For This Study
    * We are interested in how bots adopt terminology around a particular event to spread their ideology.
    * Specifically focused within political Subreddits in Reddit.

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== Reddit
    * Social media that aggregates user submitted posts.
        ** May be related to news, current events, interests, etc.
    * Posts are upvoted/downvoted by other users.
    * Users can comment on posts.
        ** Comments can also be upvoted or downvoted.

=== Repeated Exposure to Misinformation
    * According to link:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30247057[Pennycook et al.], repeated exposure to misleading content increases the perceived accuracy of the content being consumed.
        ** They argue that tagging news content as possibly being misleading may not help the problem.
    * So why does this matter?

[background-color = "#222831"]
== Research Questions

Within the context of Reddit:

. Is it possible to detect abnormalities in term usage rates over time within social media communities using an algorithm that quantifies node structure similarities between layers of a multiplex network?
. How do communities with dishonest moderating practices differ from widely accessible communities on Reddit when differences between networks are quantified?

[background-color = "#222831"]
== Hypothesis

=== RQ1

In regards to the D coefficient for determining differences between network
layers:

* H null: D coefficient does not differ between different monthly aggregated
layers for each subreddits and each term.
* H1: D coefficient is statistically different between different monthly aggregated layers for any subreddits and any term.

=== RQ2

In regards to the Network Portrait Divergence coefficient for determining differences between networks:

* H null: NPD coefficient does not differ between different aggregated layers
for all subreddits in each term.
* H1: NPD coefficient is statistically different between different aggregated
subreddits networks of any term.

== Literature Review

_Definitions_

* +++<u>Bots</u>+++ - Systems that are designed to hold conversations with humans. Generally automated software agents. 
* +++<u>Bot Nets</u>+++ - Networks of bot accounts that are used in Command Control networks to launch attacks.
* +++<u>Multiplex Network</u>+++ - Multi layered network where each layer is a graph and each layer's nodes are shared between layers.

=== Methods for Detecting Social Bots

* According to link:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306457319313937[Orabi et al.] there are 4 major methods for detecting social bots and social botnets.
    ** Graph Based
    ** Machine Learning Based
    ** Crowd Sourcing Based
    ** Anomaly Based - Usually integrated into other methods.

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== Drawbacks - Machine Learning Based 

* link:https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00975[BotOrNot] - Domain specific to Twitter and the features that it can extrapolate from user accounts.
* link:https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/document/6465541[CATS: Characterizing automation of Twitter spammers] - Uses less features to categorize bots. Domain specific. CATS makes assumptions about how bots are supposed to act online. 
* link:https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/document/6465541[DeBot] - Makes a strong assumption: "humans cannot be highly synchronous for a long duration, thus, highly synchronous user accounts are most likely bots"

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== Drawbacks - Crowd Sourcing 

[%step]
* Significant overhead can be involved. 
* There may be disagreement between raters.
* Expert raters can be difficult to find.
* Does not scale well

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== Graph Based Detection Methods

[%step]
* Typically combined with other methods in order to gain more context into why bots are acting they way they are.
    ** link:https://www.cs.unm.edu/~nabuelrub/BotCamp/[BotCamp] - System that uses link:https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/document/6465541[DeBot] to tag classify bots and then graphs are abstracted from their interactions. These graphs are used to then cluster those nodes into communities and another model is then used to determine if those groups are in agreance or disagreance with some topic. 
* According to link:https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313294.3313386[Hurtado et al.] it is possible to find bots in Reddit because they typically have high edge weights.
    ** However these are highly visible bots, typically with the word "bot" in the username.

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== BotNet Detection Methods

* In order to detect coordinated behavior link:https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7422020[Wang et al.] proposes finding anomalies known as pivotal nodes which act as botnet leaders. 
* link:https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3320269.3384770[Lingam et al.] multi layered system using ML and graph based methods to detect coordinated behavior online.

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== BotNet Detection Methods - SpamCom
* In the spirit of this paper, link:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10844-017-0494-z[SpamCom] aims to find spam botnets on Twitter. 
    ** SpamCom conceptualizes Twitter data as multilayered networks to use a graph based approach to find overlapping nodes and structural anomalies.
    ** Looks for users with content similarity and then determines the node modularity to group these nodes into communities.

[background-color = "#222831"]
== The Problem

* Some of the methods presented have high overhead with the implementation of ML systems to classify accounts as bots or not.
* These systems can attempt to draw information about what a bot or a series of bots is trying to achieve but may not do so.
* Can we use this missing information to perform exploratory analysis in a network where we would expect some behavior to occur?

[background-color = "#222831"]
== Methodology

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== Data Collection

* link:https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08435[PushShift API]
* Pulled posts and comments for the following Subreddits:
    ** r/Conservative
    ** r/Progressive
    ** r/Democrats
    ** r/Republicans
* Between the time frame: January 01, 2020 - June 30, 2020
* Only posts containing more than 5 comments

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== Graph Abstraction

* Node - Node relationships were abstracted the following way:
    ** For a term, if the term of interest is used in the title of a post, then it is assumed that every comment that occurs within that post is related to the term that is present in the title.
    ** For a term, if the term of interest is used by a user when commenting on a post, a connection is formed between the user commenting and the author of the post.
* Aggregation
    ** For RQ1 - For each term, for each subreddit, the graphs were filtered month by month. 
    ** For RQ2 - For each term, for each subreddit, the graphs for the entire time frame were aggregated. 

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== Terms in Question

* covid19
* covid
* chinavirus
* coronavirus
* corona
* rona

[background-color = "#222831"]
== Analysis

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== RQ1 

* link:https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13928[D Measure - Schieber et al.] 
    ** Dissimilarity measure ranging from 0 to 1 where a `D` value of 0 represents two graphs that are the same. A `D` measure of 1 would indicate that the two graphs are completely different in structure.
    ** Measure that aims to capture topological characteristics of two graphs for comparison.

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== D Coefficient

image::d_coeff.png[]

* Part 1 - Connectivity Characteristics (how large is the graph, average distance, etc)
* Part 2 - Network Node Dispersion (how far away are the nodes)
* Part 3 - Application of the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (how similar are two distributions from each other)

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== RQ2

* link:https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13928[NPD Measure - Schieber et al.] 
    ** dissimilarity measure ranging from 0 to 1 where a NPD value of 1 represents two graphs that are the same. A NPD measure of 0 would indicate that the two graphs are completely different in structure.
    ** Aims to create a "portrait" of a graph and compares it to other graphs.
    ** Application of the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (how different are two distributions from each other)
        ** In this case we focus on probability that two nodes are connected.

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== NPD Coefficient

image::kl_div.png[]

* Assumptions:
    ** Nodes may not be shared
    ** Graphs may not be within the same domain. 
    ** Differences in topology of networks is the main priority.

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== Results

* ANOVA tests were performed on all of the matrices created. 
* Results:
    ** For RQ1 - there were no statistical differences between the D measure of the months-months for any of the subreddits/terms in question.
    ** For RQ2 - there were no statistical differences between the NPD measure of the subreddit-subreddit for any of the terms in question.
* Anecdotally:
    ** The measures were able to find some indications of differences in term usage over time.

== Conclusion

For both Hypothesis we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 

[%header,cols=2*] 
|===
|RQ1
|RQ2

|None of the terms demonstrated abnormalities in network similarities over time.
|There were no abnormal adoption/usage rates of interest terms in Reddit over time.

|There were no abnormal adoption/usage rates of interest terms between Subreddits.
|There were no abnormal adoption/usage pattern of interest terms in Reddit unique to any one Subreddit of interest.
|===

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== Findings

* Within the domain that we are working in, we can not use network dissimilarity measures to detect abnormalities in term usage over time. 
* There were no differences between the usage of terms between subreddits.

[background-color = "#222831"]
=== Limitations

* As unmoderated as some of these subreddits may be, there is still some moderation structure.
* Some of the communities that have little to no moderation are deemed harmful and get banned.
    ** Fringe social medias are areas to engage in future applications of this same work.
